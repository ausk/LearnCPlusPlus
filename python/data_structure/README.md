## A Python Survival Pack

### Installation

The full set of tools we'll be using is available in
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

**Please select the Python 3 download.**

This is a big download, so if you're on conference wifi, rather
install [MiniConda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), and
install additional packages as you need them with

```
conda install package_name
```

The full list of packages you'll need:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

All of these, except for ``seaborn``, are installed by default.
