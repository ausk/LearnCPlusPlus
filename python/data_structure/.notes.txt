A. Data management, data exploration and visualization, and data processing

Data management includes the versioning of material (e.g., us-
ing snapshots, check-ins, or labeled back-ups), sharing and distri-
bution (e.g., revision control, databases, cloud storage, distributed
networks, network file servers or physical media) and cleaning
(converting the data into usable formats, interpreting elements, and
scrubbing out invalid or blank records).

Once the data is in a usable form, it can be explored to gain an in-
tuitive understanding of what it contains (and whether there are any
anomalies—such as sampling or encoding artifacts—to be aware
of). This step can include reducing the amount of data through slic-
ing or projection, calculating summary statistics, and plotting the
resulting sets in various ways.

After we’ve improved our understanding of the data, we process
it by applying more sophisticated statistical models. From these
models, we may draw inferences on newly obtained data, or use
our results to frame questions for a next round of data gathering.
After attending this part of the tutorial, attendees should have a
basic global understanding of the data science landscape


B. Part 2: The data scientist’s Python toolbox

(a) Create a numpy array and perform fundamental operations on
it.
(b) Plot one and two dimensional arrays.
(c) Load/save arrays from/to disk.
(d) Create common plotting items such as line plots, histograms,
scatter plots, density plots, error bars and error margins (on
line plots).
(e) Create a network with nodes and links and run some common
queries on it.
(f) Be able to help themselves (from online sources and via doc-
strings), should they get stuck.

C. Data Exploration

(a) Be aware of the most common ways of storing and fetch-
ing data, including revision control systems (such as Git) and
SQL, as well as formats (such as CSV, JSON).
(b) Be able to load a CSV file from disk.
(c) Be able to remove or replace missing values from a data-set.
(d) Know how to perform exploratory data visualization, includ-
ing slicing and displaying a data set.

D. Analysis

(a) Understand what a classifier is.
(b) Be familiar with the scikit-learn classifier API.
(c) Be able to construct a random forest classifier based on known
data.
(d) Be able to evaluate its classification accuracy for a new, un-
known set of data.
